Current Implementation Analysis:

* The current implementation uses Information Gain Ratio for feature selection.
* It supports numerical features but skips object (categorical) features during the best feature selection.
* It uses a simple `DecisionNode` class to represent the tree.
* The `build_tree` function recursively builds the tree until a maximum depth is reached or the number of samples is less than a minimum split size.
* The `predict` function traverses the tree to make predictions.
* The code includes basic pre-processing steps for the dataset.

Steps to Implement C5.0:

1. Handle Categorical Features:
    * Implement a method to handle categorical features effectively. C5.0 can split on multiple values of a categorical feature at once. The current implementation skips categorical features.
2. Implement Rule-Based Pruning:
    * C5.0 uses rule-based pruning to simplify the decision tree and improve its generalization performance. Implement a pruning algorithm to remove unnecessary branches or rules from the tree.
3. Implement Boosting:
    * C5.0 supports boosting, which involves building multiple decision trees and combining their predictions. Implement boosting to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.
4. Missing Value Handling:
    * Implement a strategy to handle missing values in the dataset. C5.0 can handle missing values by assigning probabilities to different branches or using surrogate splits.
5. Implement Global Pruning:
    * Implement global pruning methods like error-based pruning.
6. Implement Separate Training and Test Sets:
    * The current implementation trains and predicts on the same dataset. Separate the data into training and test sets for a more accurate evaluation of the model's performance.
7. Implement Confidence Factor:
    * Implement the confidence factor to avoid overfitting.
8. Consider Feature Interactions:
    * Explore the possibility of incorporating feature interactions to capture more complex relationships in the data.
